/*
STL :

standard template library:

1) containers :  data structures which are pre implemented in the cPP

        a) sequential :
            vectors:
            stack:
            queue:
            pairs:

        b)ordered:
            maps
            multimap
            set
            multiset

        c)unodered set:
            unoredered map
            unordered set

    nested containers: vector<vector<int>>
                         map<int,vector<int>>

2) iterators:
    used to point the memory address
    begin()
    end()

3) algorithm:
    upper bound
    lower bounnd
    sort - (comparator)
    max - element
    min - element
    accumulate
    reverse
    count
    find
    next permutations
    press permutaions

4)fucntors:
    classes which can act as functions
