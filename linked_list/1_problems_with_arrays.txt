int arr[100] --> fixed suze array

we can still use the vectors which grow automatically

vectors store the value at contiguous location.

they are dynamic size arrays.

-------------------------------------

problems with array is that we have to prealloacte the size.
the size is sometimes less but cant increase and sometimes it is wasted.

problems with vectors is insertion is O(n).
working .

insertion in the middle is costly.
