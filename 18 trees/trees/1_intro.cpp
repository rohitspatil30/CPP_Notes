/*
Tree is a non linear data structure which stores the value in hirarchial structure,

each tree has a root

leaf

child

parent

subtree

descents

ancesters

degree : numbers of children

intgral nodes : nodes with degree!=0

// ----------------------------

applications :
use to represent hirarchial data,
example : ceo -> cto -> managers -> workers
html code :  nesting of tags
in oops : inheariatance, children class
binary search tree
binary heap
implementing b/ b+ trees
minimum spanning tree
sparses tree
trie
suffix tree
binary inex tree
segment tree
avl tree
red black tree
